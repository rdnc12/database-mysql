In an outpatient clinic, agreements are made and registered that patients make with specialists. For patients, the number, name, date of birth and gender are always noted. A specialist has a code, a name and an extension number.
When registering an appointment, the date and time are noted. A patient can only have one appointment at one time, this also applies to the specialists.
With an appointment it is noted in which treatment room the appointment will take place. There are different types of treatment rooms, such as Operation, Research and Office.
A treatment room has a unique number consisting of the floor number and the number of the room itself.
The outpatient clinic consists of several floors and each floor has its own specialty.
